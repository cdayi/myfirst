Arrays are list-like objects whose prototype has methods to perform traversal and
. Neither the length of a JavaScript array nor the types of its elements are fixed.
 Since an array's length can change at any time, and data can be stored at non-contiguous
  locations in the array, JavaScript arrays are not guaranteed to be dense; this depends
   on how the programmer chooses to use them. In general, these are convenient characteristics;
    but if these features are not desirable for your particular use, you might consider using
typed arrays.
